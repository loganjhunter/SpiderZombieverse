Spider Zombieverse 7 Days to Die mod

We're venturing Into the Spider Zombieverse! It seems like wave after wave of endless zombies galloping on all fours have infested the world. Here we'll find new items, weapons, and other things to help (or hinder) us along the way. Though be warned, some zombies can become quite Enraged....
Here it is folks. The first multiplayer stream in a while and a first with no filters! NSFW!
This is a completely custom mod created by our own LoganJHunter.
I look forward to see what craziness he's come up with this time around and a little nervous at what creations he brought to life! 
Big thanks to MaryB and Three Thirty as well!
